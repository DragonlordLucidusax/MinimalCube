# MinimalCube
Minimal command-line or graphical cube scrambling algorithm.
Dependent on Python install, coded in Python 3.10 - both for GUI and CLI.

A small project I threw together in a few hours - mostly as an exercise to use TKinter in Python. Still, there's some use-case for this script if you are likely to be without internet for some time, and is theoretically more efficient than other methods of random number generation such as dice or animal intestines.

Use the .exe files in the windows package to use it graphically or execute the python script to use it from the command-line.
